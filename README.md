This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bike purchase behavior based on various demographic and lifestyle factors. The dashboard was created using Excel and presents visual insights into how income, age, gender, commuting distance, and other characteristics influence bike purchasing decisions.

Data Insights Summary:

The bike sales analysis revealed several key insights. Out of a total of 1,000 customers, 481 purchased bikes. The middle-aged group made up the majority of bike buyers, contributing 383 purchases—indicating that this age bracket is the most active in terms of bike ownership. Commute distance also played a significant role; customers commuting 0–1 miles were the most likely to purchase a bike, accounting for 200 purchases. This suggests that individuals with shorter commutes may prefer biking as a practical and convenient option. Gender-based income analysis showed that males who purchased bikes had the highest average income at £60,123.97, followed by females at £55,774.06, highlighting a possible correlation between higher income levels and the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
