Females: £55,774.06
Males: £60,123.97
Insight: Bike buyers have higher average income compared to non-buyers, with males having the highest average.

2. Bike Purchase Rate by Gender
KPI Name: Gender-Based Bike Purchase Income Gap

Data Insights Summary:

The bike sales analysis revealed several key insights. Out of a total of 1,000 customers, 481 purchased bikes. The middle-aged group made up the majority of bike buyers, contributing 383 purchases—indicating that this age bracket is the most active in terms of bike ownership. Commute distance also played a significant role; customers commuting 0–1 miles were the most likely to purchase a bike, accounting for 200 purchases. This suggests that individuals with shorter commutes may prefer biking as a practical and convenient option. Gender-based income analysis showed that males who purchased bikes had the highest average income at £60,123.97, followed by females at £55,774.06, highlighting a possible correlation between higher income levels and the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
